# npm stands for node package manager

- it's a tool we use to install and manage software packages written in javascript.
- you can think of it like the command line version of pip (python) or gem (ruby).
- npm packages are node modules that are created by third parties.
- they contain code, documentation, tests, and metadata files.
- when you run `npm init`, you create a new package with a name, description, version, main file, etc.
